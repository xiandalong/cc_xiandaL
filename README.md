# Insight Code Challenge by Xianda Long

This is for fullfiling the requirements for code challenge from Insight Data Engineering Program

Both programs yielded correct output Ubuntu (14.04.2, 32bit) 

Notes:

1. "-" and "'" are removed from the original text files. e.g. "hi-phen" will become "hiphen", "we're" will become "were".

2. If the input folder is empty, the program will terminate early with a message, no output files will be generated.
